# RatingWeb: Websites Evaluation Using Opinion Mining

## *This project is to fulfill the requirements of CMSE201 (Fundamentals of Software Engineering) course at EMU where we were asked to submit a PPM, SRS and Final Report for WebRating website that evaluates websites using opinion mining*. 


This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of a project that aims to evaluate websites using opinion mining techniques. The project involves building a web crawler to collect data, preprocessing the data to remove noise and irrelevant information, and applying opinion mining algorithms to assign sentiment scores to each piece of text.

The documentation includes three key documents: a Project Plan/Proposal/Management (PPM), a Software Requirements Specification (SRS), and a Final Report. The PPM outlines the project's scope, objectives, budget, timeline, and resource allocation, while the SRS defines the software requirements, including the system architecture, user interfaces, data models, and performance requirements. The Final Report summarizes the entire project, including the project overview, scope, methodology, results, and conclusion, and provides insights into the project's success, challenges, and lessons learned.
